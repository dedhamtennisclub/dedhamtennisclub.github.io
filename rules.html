    <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Please sign yourself in before you play, in addition to any guests.  Guest fees are based on number of visits.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>$50 for members bringing guests to play fewer than 10 times</li>
      <li>$100 for members bringing guests 10 or more times per season</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Children under 19 have priority on courts 3 and 4, Monday – Friday from 1 PM to 4 PM, except holidays. At all other times, member’s children must give way to waiting adults (unless playing with at least one adult).</li>
    <li>Nets should be left up and not be lowered at the end of the day.</li>  
    <li>Smooth soled tennis sneakers must be worn. No running shoes, cleated shoes, “docksiders”, or bare feet.  If you leave footprints in the clay, it is too wet to play.</li>
    <li>All members and guests are required to wear suitable tennis attire (not necessarily white). Shirts must be worn at all times.</li>
    <li>If other adult members are waiting, no non-tournament match shall continue past (whichever is shorter):</li>
    <ul><li>Two completed sets, or</li>    
        <li>1.5 hours for doubles or 1 hour for singles</li>
    </ul>    
    <li>Please sweep the courts and lines after you have finished play!</li>
    <li>Please do not play on courts that have not sufficiently dried following heavy rains.</li>
    </ol>
